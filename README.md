This repository/project is a fork of Professor Karl Morris's repository titled "HelloWorldLab".
This application, when ran, will showcase a screen that says "Hello World!".
Underneath of the "Hello World!" text there is a textbox where you are instructed to 'Enter your name',
and a button that reads 'CLICK ME', however, these do not have functionality attached to them.
Please see the screenshot listed above for the display of said application.

This project is useful because it showcases a working landing page that is shown upon running the application.

Users can get started with the project very simply, you must first _fork_ the repository so that you can create your own, then with that remote repo, you
can clone it onto your machine locally (done in android studio). Then, it may take a while for all of the files and formatting to load, but once it is done,
you can select which device you would like to emmulate to run the project on.

This repository is maintained by Nathan Marzina, after it was forked from Professor Karl Morris.
